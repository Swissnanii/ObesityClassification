# Classification Project:Obesity Clasification

## What is the objective of the project?
This project focuses on obesity classification using machine. 
The goal is to develop a predictive model that classifies individuals into obesity categories based on various health and lifestyle factors

## What is the data used in the project?
The dataset in the project is from the UCI repository **repository link [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition**.
The data includes information about key features related to obesity, such as:
The individuals in this dataset are from Mexico, Peru and Columbia.

-**Age**: The age of the individual.
-**Meals Day**:How many meals the individual eats
-**Snacks**: Frequency of snack consumption
-**Cal Monitor**: If they track their calories
-**Phys_Activity**: How many hours of physical activity the indiviual does 

## Model Performance
-**Accuracy:** 85%
-**Precision:** 86%
-**Recall (Sensitivity):** 85%
- The model performed well overall, but fine-tuning may be needed for **Group 1 and Group 5**, Which had the lowest precision and recall.

## Feature Importance
The most influential factors in predicting obesity were:
1. **Weight**
2. **Age**
3. **Water intake**
